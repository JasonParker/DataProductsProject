### Quick overview
This app demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using the airquality data set. The app shows that as you increase the number of samples and/or the number of observations per samples, a histogram of the means will center around the theoretical mean of the variable.

### How to use the app
1. Select the number of samples with the “number of samples” slider.
2. Select the number of observations per sample with the “number of observations per sample” slider.
3. The histogram will be drawn each time you change one of the variables.
4. The red vertical line on the histogram corresponds to the actual mean of the wind speed variable. You’ll find the actual mean value in the left side panel.
